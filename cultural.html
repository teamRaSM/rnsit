                            We also had with us, Mr. Nagaraj who is an IT trainer in SAMARTHANAM TRUST for the differently abled people. He explained how these physically and mentally challenged youth were being trained, the phase through which these people learn various fields. Their main aim is to make these people as "Taxpayers of the country rather than being a pensioner". We were then shown a documentary regarding the charity being done by this organisation. This was followed by a MOCK FIRE DRILL by the fire brigade, where different types of extinguishers and various ways of smothering fire were taught to us. Some students also got the privilege to operate the instruments directed by the fire crew. New fittings used by the fire department in real situations were also demonstrated. The donation event was started @ 10.30am. Many students offered clothes, money as well as stationary to the trust to extend their helping hands. Meanwhile, the 2nd, 4th and 6th semester civil students staged a street play in front of the college canteen having the theme as HARASSMENT ON WOMEN which came out beautifully and was appreciated by everyone.</p>
